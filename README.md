## ZTE LTE Band Locker & Diagnostic Tool

# How to use this Tool
Just use it on the web without installation! Here are the steps to "hack" the router interface:

Using the admin password access the router web gateway (the IP address is usually 192.168.0.1, sometimes it changes).

Opening Developer Tools can be done by pressing the F12 key (it works in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox).

Going to the Console tab should be done on the top of the side panel that appears.

Make sure to copy-paste the code "code.js" into the Console.

# Optimized for Poland
The locations in this code are especially tailored to fit the Polish telecom environment (Orange, T-Mobile, Play, Plus).

Default Bands: It allows bands B1(2100MHz), B3(1800MHz), B7(2600MHz), and B20(800MHz) to be used.

Stability over Speed: Lock onto Band 7 if you live in a busy city (like Sosnowiec) to avoid interference from neighboring towers.

Global Users: If you are not in Poland, then research on your own about the local LTE frequencies before you lock a particular band.

# Real-Time Signal Monitoring
After activation, you have live data for:

SINR: Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio. This is very important for online gaming! Try to keep this value positive.

RSRP: The actual signal power you are getting from the tower.

RSRQ: The value of the quality of the signal received.
